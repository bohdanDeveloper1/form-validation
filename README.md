## Project Setup

1. Go to project directory and navigate with `cd validation`
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to compile and hot-reload for development

# I used Vue.js 3 as a framework, Vuetify 3 for UI components, and the Vee-validate library for form validation.
# All logic and validation are performed dynamically without page reloading.
# Additionally, I made the form responsive (RWD). I used the REST API at https://httpbin.org to receive a response status after form submission.
